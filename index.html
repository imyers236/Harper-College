                    <h2>Phishing Attacks</h1>

                        <p>Phishing uses email, phone calls, texts or malicious websites to solicit personal information by posing as a trustworthy organization.  
                            For example, an attacker may send an email from a seemingly reputable credit card company that requests your account information. 
                            Usually under the guise that there is a problem or a need of information.</p>



                        <h2>Phishing Emails might have</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>spelling errors</li>

                            <li>uncommon phrasing</li>
                            <li>Say it is urgent</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>How to Avoid Phishing</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Avoid emailing your personal information</li>
                            <li>Hover over links to see where they go</li>
                            <li>Check the sender's address matches the email's contents 
                                Ex: a credit card company will not use @hotmail to email you</li>
                            <li>If unsure contact the company directly</li>
                        </ul>

                    <h1 class="arrow">▼</h1>
                </div>
                <div class="content">
                    <h2>Password Guideline:</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Harper account passwords must be between 6-20 characters and contain both letters and numbers</li>                        
                        <li>Use both upper and lowercase letter, number, and special characters</li>
                        <li>Avoid putting PII (Ex: name or birthdate) into your password to make it harder to guess</li>
                        <li>Research indicates a longer, more memorable password can provide better security than a shorter password with added complexity</li>
                        <li>Passwords should not be reused for different accounts or websites. If one of your accounts gets compromised, then all the other accounts that use the same login name and password or even just the password can easily be compromised.</li>
                        <li>To avoid forgetting passwords or reusing them, get a password manager that can hold them for you</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Securing Mobile Devices</h2>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Configure a passcode to gain access to and use the device.</li>
                        <li>Leave your Bluetooth turned off when you are not using it. Bluetooth connections should be
                            done in private, uncrowded areas.</li>
                        <li>Enroll your device in Find My iPhone or an equivalent service. This will help you locate
                            your device should it be lost or stolen.</li>
                        <li>Install security updates.</li>
                        <li>Backup your data regularly. It is recommended to sync your mobile device with your computer.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Identity Theft</h2>

                    <p>Identity theft is a serious crime. Identity theft happens when someone uses information about you
                        without your permission. They could use your:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Name and address</li>
                        <li>Credit card or bank account numbers</li>
                        <li>Social security number</li>
                        <li>Medical insurance account numbers</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Some warning signs that you may be a victim of identity theft are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Errors on your credit or bank statements</li>
                        <li>Errors on your credit report</li>
                        <li>Late or missing bills</li>
                        <li>Receiving credit cards you did not apply for</li>
                        <li>Calls or letters about purchases you did not make</li>
                        <li>Denials of credit or being offered less favorable terms for no apparent reason</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>If you believe your identity has been stolen, a helpful guide is available from the Federal Trade
                        Commission at <a href="https://www.identitytheft.gov">www.identitytheft.gov</a>.</p>

                        <li>Is this information necessary for the topic?</li>

                        <li>PII should only be stored in private protected drives assigned by the college</li>

                        <li>Avoid putting PII in emails (even to send to one's self) or other forms of unprotected communication such as text</li>
